Description of how proejct works:

This projects uses 2 .py file to work:
1. app.py - > This script creates the ML model and saves it.
2.original_code1.py -> This script uses the model, take user input, predicts flower type and colles user feedback on model's performance.

A. First script- app.py

1. We can import which ML model we want to use and other supporting libraries.
2. We need a csv with feature and label and sript will split the data and train the model
3. Script saves the model so that it can be sued in any other script we make.

B. Second script - original_code1.py

1. We need to install streamlit library in environment we want to use the project.
2. We import all other libraries to use model, collect feedback and etc
3. We create a methis to load the model with resource caching so that after first time user does not ahve to waut lon gfor model to predict
   the flower time as the loaded model will be cached so it runs immediately.
4. A method user_input_feature has been creted which will collect user flower dimesion as his input and this methid can be changed to suit any other
   proejct requirement as in what else is needed to include as input from user. And these user inputs are diplayed of left sidebar on screen with dimesion and  units.
5. Model is called and saved user input in dataframe is fed to model to predict the flower type and predicted flower type is diplayed to user in the 
   middle of screen.
6. next we call feedback colector and define few question for user to give feedback on how model performed and this feedback  script can be modified 
  to suit other project's requirement and user is asked to save the feedback.
7. Saved feedback is collected and sahred with ML engineer team to see the difference in what model performed and what user thinks about it performance
   so the ML team can see the difference and modify the ML model to improve its performance.
